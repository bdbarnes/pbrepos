Reading Response: Hydrothermal Vents and the Origin of Life (Martin et al., 2008)

Article Summary:
	Research into the origins of life on this planet have supported numerous and diverse hypotheses, ranging from the Òprebiotic soupÓ concept to an extraterrestrial origin of the first organic molecules. The main difficulty lies in proposing a viable environment that both existed ~4.0Ga, provided a nurturing environment for the evolution of more complex molecules, and provided a source of reduced carbon. Martin et al. posit in this review that a burgeoning understanding of seafloor hydrothermal vent systems may provide the perfect template for the genesis of organic life. The traditional image of hydrothermal vents is a black smoker, a type of vent which occurs along spreading ridges, hosts microbial life, and are powered by super hot (~400¼C) acidic seawater rich in transition metals which seep up from contact with subsurface magma chambers. However, the lesser-known vent the authors focus on are the off-axis vents such as the Lost City system, where ~200¼C water emissions are circulated by means of convection from mantle heat, diverse bacterial metabolisms abound, and fluids are rich in alkaline minerals. Both types of vents are sites for serpentinization, a reaction of water with iron species to form basic hydrocarbons, but the abiogenic synthesis of CH4 at the Lost City type particularly is reminiscent of early microbial metabolisms. The authors hypothesize that the relatively lower temperatures and high pH of the Lost City-type vents, reduced carbon is thermodynamically favored and a chemiosmotic pH gradient between basic vent water and the neutral ocean could have fostered the first biological chemolithoautotrophy, spurring the evolution of more complex organic cells and metabolisms. While the answer to the origin of life has not been definitively resolved, Martin et al provide a compelling argument for a geochemical evolution at the site of ancient hydrothermal vents.

Things you Liked about this Paper:
	Martin et al provide a thorough context the the question of the origin of life, taking the time to detail other prevailing hypotheses and moreover some of the evidence which support other ideas. The reminder that some lines of evidence support multiple theories and cannot rule out alternatives was essential to understanding the complexity of the question: there is no simple smoking gun, and that makes this question all the more worth studying. The authors had no tone of superiority with their review, but instead gave a fair and balanced assessment of their ideas, and urged for further research.
I also admired how the authors took the time to explain the background of several facets of their hypothesis. By elaborating on the geologic setting of the vents, the biological metabolisms at play, and the chemical factors involved at the sites, I felt better informed by their review.

Things you Did Not Like about this Paper:
	While I appreciate the fact that the authors were covering a broad interdisciplinary question, I have some reservations with the level of detail in some of their explanations. Undoubtedly a review in a Microbiology journal is pitched more towards specialists, but as a relative layperson I would have benefited more from fewer details spent on the lists of different metabolisms and biochemical reactions and more explanation spent on why and how we know what the first metabolisms and organisms in life might have been like. As much as the reader benefits from their fair treatment of alternative hypotheses, it would have also been more powerful to hear more about why the hydrothermal vent origin of life hypothesis is supported where others are not, or what makes it particularly compelling in contrast to other ideas. The review article ended on a nice note of pushing for future research, but even more powerful would have been a section detailing the questions that remain, what mysteries have yet to be uncovered, and what specifically could be done in the future to better understand the question.

Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:
	The figures are detailed and informative, but to a fault. In a review paper, the reader benefits most from figures which augment their understanding of the text but in a supportive way, rather than embarking upon whole new paragraphs of information. Figure 1, the map, is easy to read if slightly irrelevant. Figure 2 does a great job of graphically contextualizing hydrothermal vents, although its lengthy caption seems to be an excuse to squeeze in more information than strictly necessary. Similarly, Table 1 and Figure 3 are complex and overly crammed with information: those who already understand the chemical reactions will know enough not to need the lengthy figures, and those who are new to metabolic equations will not be aided by them. Like the figure captions, the supplementary text boxes often seem overly detailed: although this broad subject benefits from more explanation, it often seems like the reader could benefit instead from a less technical review article.
