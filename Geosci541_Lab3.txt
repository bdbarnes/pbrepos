Geosci 541 Ð PaleobiologyLab Exercise 3 (2/15/16)Ben Davis BarnesQuestions 1 Ð Part 11. There are 704 collections associated with this reference.2. The article reference id is 24429Questions 1 Ð Part 21. This citation (Conrad 1830) is the first citation in which this species was identified and given a taxonomic name.2.	Class: Strophomenata	Order: Strophomenida	Family: Strophomenidae	Genus: Strophomena	Species: planumbona3. The data was collected in Union County, in Indiana.4. The data is from the Ordovician period.5. The data was collected in the Liberty Formation.Questions 21. The colors signify the identified era, period, or epoch for the fossil collection.2. Ypresian Abra collections are found in the USA (Alabama), the UK, and Belgium.3. The city with the most collections of Ambonychiacea in the United States is Cinncinnati, OH.4. Most Ambonychiacea occur during the Ordovician.1. Most occurrences were arrayed parallel to the equator during the Ordovician.2. Ambonychiacea belongs to the order Myalinida.Questions 31. https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list.json?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Ambonychia&strat=Lexington Limestone2. https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Mammalia&interval=Paleocene,Oligocene 3.https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/taxa/opinions.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Testudines&interval=Mesozoic4.https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Aves, Marsupialia, Sirenia&cc=US5. https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=FicusQuestions 41. The family for genus Gastrocopta is Gastrocoptidae.2. The one occurrence of Isoetes in Portugal is found in the Aptian of the Cretaceous.3. The oldest occurrence of Gastrocopta is from the Bridgerian of the Eocene.4. The one occurrence of Tiktaalik from the Frasnian of the Devonian was located in the tropics.5. The two Siberian occurrences of Namacalathus are found in the Kotodzha and Raiga Formation.Questions 51.>URL <- Òhttps://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=Mammut&interval=PlioceneÓ>Mammut <Ð read.csv(URL,row.names=1)2. >dim(Mammut)    [1] 39 123. It uses the collections parameters.4. The genus is Mammut, the genus name for Mastodon. The call is limited to the Pliocene.5. https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=Mammut&interval=Miocene,Pliocene6. https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Mammut&interval=Miocene,Pliocene&show=locQuestions 6 Ð API Function in R1.downloadpbdb <- function(taxon,interval){	Fsect <- c("https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=")	Tax <- c(taxon)	Ssect <- c("&interval=")	Int <- c(interval)	URL <- paste(Fsect,Tax,Ssect,Int,sep="")	read.csv(URL)}Questions 7 Ð Morphological Measurements1.Based on the average measurements for the three species, the mean Wdth:Diam is:	Species A = 0.236	Species B = 0.260	Species C = 0.260While this allows for a comparison of the Wdth:Diam data from the ammonite csv file, that two of the species have the same Wdth:Diam ratio would obscure potential species assignments. Furthermore, as we saw in our example of species analysis from the past lab, comparing the Wdth:Diam between species yielded no significant results, suggesting that Wdth:Diam is a poor differentiator. Finally, that the ammonite csv file contained a range of ontogenetic stages and sexes, furthering eroding the confidence of a single species mean, makes it difficult to assign species to our previous lab specimens based on these broad, averaged figures, with any degree of confidence.2. Xenoceltites variocostatus was first referenced by Brayard and Bucher, 2008, in an article entitled ÒSmithian (Early Triassic) ammonoid faunas from northwestern Guangxi (South China): taxonomy and biochronology.Ó3. Yes, I can hypothesize qualitatively which specimens from Lab 2 belong to this species:	Specimens 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24These specimens correspond qualitatively to the array pictured in the plate of the publication. These specimens also correspond to all in my earlier hypothesized Ôthin biconcave ribbedÕ species and half of my Ôthick sigmoidal ribbed with ceratitic sutureÕ species.
