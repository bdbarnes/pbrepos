### Reading Response: The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction (Payne and Finnegan, 2007)


#### Article Summary:

  Although major biotic crises i.e. the "Big Five" mass extinctions receive much of the attention in big data paleontology, background extinction on the genus level are estimated to have accounted for ~80% of all extinctions. In order to understand the contrast between these gradual, constant rates and the dramatic bursts of extinction, the authors of this paper took a regression approach to analyzing geographic range in relation to extinction selectivity. Using log-odds ratios, a 0 for a given 10My interval would indicate no correlation between geographical range and extinction, whereas a positive or negative value suggests such a correlation. Through this analysis the researchers found that geographic range was positively correlated with survivorship throughout nearly all intervals over the Phanerozoic, excepting the Permo-Triassic, Triassic, and Cretaceous ME events where log-odds significantly close to 0 laid. In addition, a multiple regression incorporating species richness as well as occurrence and range showed significantly low values for each of these three events as well as the Frasnian-Famennian.
