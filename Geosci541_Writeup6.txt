Reading Response: How Good was the Fossil Record? (Valentine, 1989)

## Article Summary

Since the heavy blow dealt to paleontology in 1859 by Darwin, the science has been heavily scrutinized for the perceived spottiness and unreliability of the fossil record. Haven been likened to an informative book filled with ripped-out pages and with only a few informative paragraphs remaining intact, the science of paleontology was relegated to the back burner for nearly a century, as more of a hobby or infantile younger brother of biology. However, the work of quantitative macroecologists, evolutionary biologists, and taphonomists through the sixties and seventies allowed for a rise in regard for paleobiology. ValentineÕs 1989 paper epitomizes this journey, using quantitative and empirical methods to illustrate just how complete the fossil record actually is.

Limiting the study to Californian gastropod and bivalve species and their corresponding fossils from the Pleistocene, Valentine gives three important points. First, approximately 77% of extant species from this region were represented in the fossil record (and 60% of the non-represented species had moved to a different region, rather than suffered extinction), and furthermore around 90% of extant families were present in the fossil record. Secondly, the preserved fossils comprised the majority of common species today, and most of the non-fossilized species were noted to be rare, fragile, minute, or lived in the deep marine shelf (under-sampled). Finally, the terraces sampled for this study featured assemblages of ~77% of all species over the span of 1Myr, but whose sediments only represented 10% of that time. All of these points together send a clear message: that the fossil record is much more complete than previously thought, and any discrepancies in the record would be more likely due to post-depositional damage than lack of accumulation.

## Things you liked about this paper:

This paper was written very well: it had a strong point and an excellent experimental design to back up its data, but the conclusion was written in a humble manner and didnÕt try to overextend its implications. Valentine chooses an excellent way to illustrate the completeness of the record, and without using any revolutionary techniques but rather a large ecological-style study with meaningful statistics. However, he is the first to recognize the persisting flaws or problems with the fossil record, and doesnÕt try to advocate for its infallibility. This plays to the strengths of paleontology, where statistics can emphasize the extremes: certain deposits may be one-in-a-billion odds, and certain depositional alterations may occur 98% of the time, but over the years, decades, centuries, millennia etc. one winds up with enough samples which paint an accurate picture, and only certain exceptional situations create a real gap in the record that cannot be overcome. Valentine concludes all this in a simple, yet elegant fashion, and reaffirms paleontologyÕs place at the high table of science.

## Things you did not like about this paper:

I was a big fan of this paper, and was inclined to be less punctilious than usual. One of my sole gripes is that some kind of a figure couldnÕt be inserted into the discussion, particularly when the author begins describing the sampling size relationship with the frequency distribution of species as a log series: that is the type of figure that could have been easily included, rather than just referenced. However, the strength of the paper did not suffer from a lack of figures.

## Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

There were few figures in this paper (see above point): the one figure, Fig. 1, is a map of the sample sites which I would have gladly traded for a graph of the data or pictures of some of the morphotypes being considered. However, this figure supported the methods and made them all the more transparent. Table 1 and the Appendix were the only other figures, being a summary of the extant-fossil species comparison and the data in full, respectively. The latter again emphasizes a transparency of methods and results which supports the results, and Table 1 is all that is needed to illustrate the data. Nothing special, but certainly strong figures that help the paper.
