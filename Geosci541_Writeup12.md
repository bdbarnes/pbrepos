### Reading Response: The Red Queen and Court Jester (Benton, 2009)

In this particularly insipid review paper, Benton outlines a major bifurcation in the field of geopaleomacroecological evolutionary study: whether evolution, in the grand scheme of things, is driven more by biotic interactions and intrinsic factors (the Red Queen, posited since the days of Darwin) or rather by abiotic, extrinsic factors such as tectonics or climate changes (the Court Jester, a far less apt visualization of the author's so-called "capricious" events which in actuality act on a far longer time scale, 10^5 years for example, and often over many millions of years: if anything, the comparison should be between the flighty and sharp Red Queen, concerned as she was with the propriety of interactions on the chess board and insistent on competition, and the Jabberwock, a spectacular and horrifying symbol of power and inhumanity with huge destructive tendencies, the very epitomy of life's horror at the seemingly monstrous appetite for death of the geologic realm: as much as humans try to anthropomorphize the abiotic, it is uncaring, unfeeling, and by that same token unhating or unspiteful. An image of senseless but meaningful slaughter, the Jabberwock fits both the Lewis Carroll motif and actually embodies a large, slow-moving but vicious juggernaut of destructive capabilities, which far more behooves the abiotic realm's forcing of life and its evolution).
