### Reading Response: The Red Queen and Court Jester (Benton, 2009)

#### Article Summary:

In this particularly insipid review paper, Benton outlines a major bifurcation in the field of geopaleomacroecological evolutionary study: whether evolution, in the grand scheme of things, is driven more by biotic interactions and intrinsic factors (the Red Queen, posited since the days of Darwin) or rather by abiotic, extrinsic factors such as tectonics or climate changes (the Court Jester, a far less apt visualization of the author's so-called "capricious" events which in actuality act on a far longer time scale, 10^5 years for example, and often over many millions of years: if anything, the comparison should be between the flighty and sharp Red Queen, concerned as she was with the propriety of interactions on the chess board and insistent on competition, and the Jabberwock, a spectacular and horrifying symbol of power and inhumanity with huge destructive tendencies, the very epitomy of life's horror at the seemingly monstrous appetite for death of the geologic realm: as much as humans try to anthropomorphize the abiotic, it is uncaring, unfeeling, and by that same token unhating or unspiteful. An image of senseless but meaningful slaughter, the Jabberwock fits both the Lewis Carroll motif and actually embodies a large, slow-moving but vicious juggernaut of destructive capabilities, which far more behooves the abiotic realm's forcing of life and its evolution).

More to the point, Benton typifies the two viewpoints as being more a question of scale than aptness. He frames the debate in the context of Phanerozoic biodiversity, providing another contrast between the equilibrium model of diversification (diversification is capped at a limit or carrying capacity over time) and the expansionist model (there is no set limit to diversification, but its rates are dampened over time). Having set the stage for biodiversity theory, the author outlines historical factors in large-scale trends over geologic time, including tectonic events, energy availability, temperature/climate, ecospace availability, or increasing specialization of species over time. Turning to his beloved dinosaurs for a relatively weak illustration of phylogenetic theory and how diversification occurs. In conclusion, he goes on to tout the importance of paleontological time scales to ecological studies, and vice versa. He ends the paper with one final flaccid sentence, an ineffectual phrase which simultaneously is concise enough to have made the need for this entire paper irrelevent, a testament to Benton's disinterest in introducing any real knowledge or opinion to the reader.
  

#### Things you liked about this paper:

The typeface was nice, and the title inherently pleases me. In more seriousness, the author attempted to take no stance which rules out either theory, and so ends up constructing a fairly diplomatic ode to both, who strengths lie in emphasizing why both theories add to our conceptualization of evolution, and are thus both necessary. And he is not wrong when he sums up in his final sentence, "sometimes the scale of things matters: bigger things matter more when you are farther, and when you are closer little things matter more."


#### Things you did not like about this paper:

This paper simultaneously felt scrawled out at the last minute by a procrastinating college student, and lazily written with no real concern to the central message. What starts off introducing a rather engaging summation of two contrasting theories deviates quickly to plod along talking about how diversity is studied through time, eventually drunkenly making its way back to the initial points by page three in which an unorganized slew of examples of factors in biodiversification are listed, in the manner of an introductory chapter to a college paleontology textbook. Quickly feeling out of his depth, the author scurries back to the safety of his dinosaur expertise despite the superiority of large-scale invertebrate fossils in such a study. Every example feels only superficially covered, and more importantly isn't sufficiently tied back to the central review subject! Structure is nonexistant, and the paper never decides what it wants to be: a specific conceptual review of Red Queen and co., or a general review of biodiversity theory? Furthermore, the figures, graphs, and tables are egregiously worked into the paper, exposing the rushed nature of this publication by being cited in the text at a completely irrelevent point, and referring to parts A and B when no such parts are present. The most prominent figure, figure 3, is devoted to the minor dinosaur example, and the most conceptual and essential figure, Fig. 1, is lackluster, poorly explained, and poorly constructed. And finally, as mentioned above, the final sentence dangles like a wet noodle hanging off the author's academic plate as, failing to clean up his last mess, he leaves the dishes for later and moves on to the dessert of writing more about dinosaurs. The moniker, the gimmick used to get this paper any popularity at all, is weak: the actualy description and discussion of the merits of the Red Queen vs. Court Jester is weak: the paper's organization is weekest of all, never committing to an idea for longer than a page: the most valuable thing in this paper is the references, presumably a far better reading list than this four page monument to mediocrity.


#### Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

Awful. Well, at least, pretty bad.

Figure One, attempting to illustrate the conceptualization of RG/CJ, is simultaneously too simple and too compelx. A seeks to emphasize the differences in scaling, but confuses the eye with the binary between the RQ an CJ blurred by the introduction of the Apparent Red Queen which is confusingly explained in the caption as a possible confounding variable. Furthermore the labeling and scaling on the axes is laughable. Fig. 1B is no better, attempting to make a very simple point about scaling with a far too graph-like illustration which again, confuses more than it elucidates. Furthermore, it simplifies the two concepts to beign solely about scaling, rather than underlining the difference in the mechanisms driving them. Figure 2 is fairly innocuous as well as useless: showing the Sepkoski curve and the PBDB corrected curve are supposed to illustrate his point about equilbrium diversification theory, but with no real annotations the plateaus and levels he references are lost on the reader. Nitpicking, he makes reference to Fig. 2A and 2B, which don't actually exist in the figure. As an illustration of diversification theory, these curves are again fairly useless. Finally, the one figure the author bothered to clean up and write about was Fig. 3, illustrating phylogenetic dynamics in the case study of dinosaurs and crurotarsans. But even this more detailed (and largest) of the graphs fails to explain fully what the PCA axes are suggesting, and the large phylogenetic tree in Fig. 3A is overkill for the simple point he made through text.


And once again, the final sentence, which will go down to rival Watson and Crick's famous "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material," basically says that sometimes one thing is important, and sometimes the other. 

"Viewed close up, sandwiches are all about ham (Red Meat model), but from further away, the sandwich integrity is driven by the bread (Cut Breadster model)."

Viewed up close, a pointilist painting is all about dots, but from afar it's a pretty landcape. Viewed from up close the Earth is made up of people and pebbles, but from space it's a tiny little orb covered in blue. We don't need to learn from this publication that perspective changes matters, and if we did we could have asked for a slightly more entertaining way to put it. Whether the pointilist painting is made up of an image or a bunch of dots is a philosophical question; the scientific question would be to figure out how the little dots, as individuals, can to a human create the illusion of a coherent photo: or how the full-scale image can be manifested on smaller levels in those dots. How close would one have to get to the dots to lose sight of the larger picture? How far back would one have to stand to lose sight of the dots completely? If one were confined to looking at the painting from ten meters back, would they have a different interpretation of the technique and painting mechanism than someone forced to gaze at it from 10cm away? How do these biases of perspective affect the way we look at the big scale or the small scale when the other isn't available? How would we be able to predict pointilist pictures from just the dots in the future? All these and more are poorly shoehorned analogical concerns I would have liked to have read more about in an inspiring review article on the RG/CJ(Jabberwock) theories. I suppose I can wait for someone with more patience and imagination to write said paper.
