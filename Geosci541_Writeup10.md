### Reading Response: Origination, extinction, and mass depletions (Bambach, Knoll, and Wang, 2004)


#### Article Summary:

With discussions surrounding the "Big Five" mass extinctions largely focusing on the conditions surrounding these events, their nickname and importance are largely taken for granted. The authors of this paper seek to call into question what constitutes a mass extinction. When examined on a continuum of magnitude, the five infamous events stand out far less from their surroundings than previously thought.
	
Although plotting genus diversity in the style of Sepkoski yields sharp dips at each of the five boundaries, with a longer-trend Paleozoic plateau of diversity and Cenozoic rapid rise, the authors choose to analyze boundary-crossing standing diversity trends, which compares the extinction and origination rates between boundaries of each interval and gives a better picture of within-interval diversity dynamics. They rank the intervals of proportionally most devastated standing diversity to test the significance of magnitude, and find surprisingly that many of the traditional mass extinctions are poor outliers compared to the monumental high turnover during the anomalous Cambrian and Early- to Middle-Ordovician, and even with these events removed donÕt stand out particularly significantly from other intervals. In fact, when regression analysis is applied, a cluster of intervals stand out from the rest, but only the Late Ordovician, Permo-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous events. The authors then approach the standing diversity in a novel fashion by measuring the rates of both extinction and origination, and posit that the remaining to mass extinctions, the Late Devonian and Triassic, are in fact misrepresented as extinctions when in fact they are "depletions," which is to say intervals when extinction rates may not have dipped but origination did. Furthermore, when examining the five, or three, events, it is clear that not just the magnitude, but the effect and causes of each differ significantly. However, the authors conclude that the three significant events at least are not likely to be an artefact of human or natural bias, and do in fact communicate important biotic crises.

#### Things you liked about this paper:

There was a lot of creativity in this paper concerning mass extinctions, and the relatively radical hypotheses that the end-Devonian and Triassic events were products of depleted origination rather than raised extinction rates are well supported by their sampling, standardization, and statistical analysis. It was especially prudent to include the summary statistics and graphs, giving both a verifiable and visual way of seeing their trends, and although the majority of this paper was centered around different analyses the authors were very detailed in their explanations of methods. Furthermore, this is a very broad paper, in that this relatively single-minded evaluation branches off to have implications for the Big Five mass extinctions, the Cambrian and Ordovician turnover, trilobite diversity dynamics, and extinction studies in general.

#### Things you did not like about this paper:

While there are many valid reasons to be critical of labelling events as "mass extinctions," the abrupt manner in which these authors launched into it made the paper feel like a matter of semantics. The overall message should be not to think of these events in a one-dimensional way: many more crises than five have existed, and there is more than one way to examine them: turnover, origination vs. extinction, taxonomic severity, ecological severity, global environmental change. In light of these expanded criteria, there is no reason not to be critical and seek to define the Late Triassic and Late Devonian events on other grounds, since the aftermath of their "depletions" let to significant environmental and evolutionary changes. However, this paper comes off as single-minded in trying to set up standing diversity as the one measure of true mass extinctions, and write off the LD and LT events. 

#### Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:	

The many graphs in this paper are at times busy and difficult to follow along, but give the paper much of its strength. There is no better way to portray trends than graphs and figures, and the authors realize this: rather than trying to describe in detail all of the analyzed patterns, they make full use of their nine figures. In addition the two tables included provide much of the data summary statistics, allowing readers to allay their skepticism.
