### Reading Response: Determinants of Extinction in the Fossil Record (Peters and Foote, 2002)

#### Article Summary:

With the advent of big-data approaches to analyzing the fossil record, the zeniths and nadirs of preservation, and most popularly the record of mass extinctions, the understanding of its biases and weaknesses has become increasingly necessary. The deposition of rocks in non-constant, nonhomogeneous processes requires a critical eye towards the fossils within. Time periods of greater nondeposition can misrepresent the time represented by fossil assemblages, and commonly the last appearance of a species is uncertain because of these depositional fits and starts.

The authors of this paper propose comparisons between the fossil and stratigraphic record to provide a control for biases in each. Comparing genus-level extinction by stage with the amount of deposited formations, co-variations and weak correlations were found. They then propose a model which predicts extinction rates given either variable stage lengths and declining extinction, or constant stage lengths and extinction rates. This model allows the extinction rates to be estimated in relation to the preservational variation in the rock record. Further randomization allows the model to be compared to a null distribution and the significance of the modelÕs trends calculated. The fit between the model and the data support the hypotheses that either extinction trends as we know them are over-exaggerated by changes in the rock record, or that a common cause is at play behind both extinction rates and rock deposition/preservation, such as sea level change. By further modeling and examining these trends, paleontologists will be able to better identify the biases in the fossil-rock record and approach a more accurate understanding of the record of life.
 

#### Things you liked about this paper:

This was a very powerful paper which suggests a major reorganization of how paleontologists interpret the fossil record. One very strong part of the paper was that, despite its possible wide-reaching implications, the authors did not seek to overextend their conclusions, and were very up front about the uncertainties and questions that remained. Because the paper is largely based on databases and models, which still carry a sense of dubitability in paleontological studies, the tone in which it was written and advocated for future improvements was very positive.

#### Things you did not like about this paper:

The paper was very dense and hard to jump into. While it is reasonable to expect the readers to have to familiarize themselves with some basics of the field, many of the analyses and modeling terms are thrown about casually, and in fact make up to meat of the paper. The paper could have been made more approachable to the non-analytical layperson, and explanations elaborated upon. Another feature I would have welcomed is a brief introduction to the history of approaching this problem, and how this method differs from previous interpretations. However, formatting being what it is, the principle weakness of this paper was its density.

#### Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

The use of figures and graphs was very prevalent in this paper, and done well albeit with the same density of information. Figure One provides a visualization of the trends in fossil extinction rates and rock deposition, although the correlation coefficient is too small for the graphs to show any clear trends. Figure Two provides a similar template but with the model-predicted rates, and the correlations between the model and observed here is much clearer and thus a more powerful communicator of information. Finally, Figure Three compares the null distributions of the model, which seems like a roundabout way to illustrate significance. However, on the whole the figures all do a fantastic job in illustrating the complexities and challenges of the model-data analysis: if one can follow along with the text easily, the figures should provide no further difficulty. In summation, this publication has a steep learning curve, with very interesting hypotheses.
