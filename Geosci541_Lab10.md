Part 1

1) Aside from extenuating circumstances (this review partner had suffered data loss and had to quickly reassemble his proposal right before the lab), the proposal seemed to be heading towards the right length. The formatting was a little more segmented, breaking down ÔIntroduction,Õ ÔHypothesis,Õ and ÔObjective.Õ More details will be necessary for the final draft but this draft seemed to be a concerted effort to balance the proposal between background and methods.

2) The objective of this proposal was to use PBDB and ocean-circulation and climate proxy in fossils on either side of tectonically-forced ocean current shutoffs (the closure of the Panama current and the Indonesian Seaway) to better understand the effects and mechanisms of thermohaline circulation shutdown, a phenomenon which could be possible in the future as more freshwater melt from Greenland interrupts the NADW circulation.

3) I believe that the hypothesis suggests a potentially useful proxy for gaining new insight into these past events; however, I feel that the hypothesis needs to be more specific as to how the past events can serve as a proxy to future THC shutdown, as well as what specific data the researcher is hoping to measure and which proxy measurements can be used for the prediction. I think that this is a relatively novel approach to examining ocean circulation, whereas many studies of such a magnitude rely on modeling: in using several proxies from two related events, the research could gain new understandings of climate and ocean physical processes, but the researcher will have to be certain exactly what he wants to test. Because these are relatively recent closures, it should be very feasible to take fossils from the sites with well-constrained paleolocations; however, again, more detail as to what should be measured and what hypothesis it hopes to test must come first. The strong part of the proposal comes from its scientific relevance: as a potential novel proxy for a disastrous possible outcome of climate change, there is a certain urgency/fundability inherent to the problem.

4 and 5) The major hurdle for this proposal is to find similar past studies and narrow down specifically what data they are hoping to measure and how they will use it. While fossils can record lots of geochemical proxies such as oxygen, carbon, and neodymium isotopes and trace elements to indicate past circulatory patterns or climates, the researcher must know first exactly why he is measuring for them. The methods will be the major improvement necessary by the final draft: how will the researcher avoid bias, gain a significant sample size, estimate uncertainty, and form conclusions? One suggestion is to find existing ocean-circulation/climate models for these events and seek to augment them with novel empirical data. I suggested in particular finding similar studies for inspiration, and cleaning up the broader importance paragraph, since climate change is a real strength in a proposal.

6) The paper made good use of background literature for the subjects of circulation proxies and tectonic seaway closures. However, I would have appreciated some references to bolster the proposed methods and conclusions, to show that this is a problem that is important to be understood and which others have already worked on, even if no one has used this approach before.

Part 2
1) The reviewer understood the hypothesis well; I supplemented with some explanation as to the broader implications of a potential land-plant Devonian marine feedback cycle.

2) The reviewer did not see a lot of societal relevance to this project on the surface, but suggested I flesh out better the comparison to modern-day eutrophic events and consequences. He seemed to think that it was scientifically interesting and a good direction for a future study.

3) The reviewer thought the analytical methods were well-proposed, although he specified that more details and specific plans could be developed for the next draft.

4) The reviewer did a good job of evaluating my proposal. I think I would have appreciated more constructive criticism, but the reviewer was quick to point out the strengths which was also helpful. The reviewer either understood everything in the proposal or didnÕt ask about parts he didnÕt which would have been helpful too.

5) My next few steps will involve cleaning up my introduction and background research, and then moving toward finding existing studies and methods to propose more specific approaches to the problem. Furthermore, in contrast to the broad questions asked in this draft, I will formulate a more specific hypothesis for the next draft with specific plans for testing.

Part 1

1) I felt like this proposal also needed to be fleshed out into a larger product, but the basic structure and scaffolding was apparent. The researcher had a well-defined hypothesis modeled after an existing study (Droser et al., 2000); however, the proposal was lacking in details in the societal importance and methods section, which should be developed for the final draft.

2) This proposal was modeled off of the Droser et al. 2000 paper which compared and contrasted the taxonomic and ecological severity of the late Ordovician and late Devonian mass extinctions. In this proposal the author sought to compare the late Triassic and KT mass extinctions, given their approximately similar magnitude of taxonomic loss. The researcher proposed to utilize the PBDB in order to track diversity and abundance of dominant species or ecologically vital keystone species, in order to monitor the ecological response to the mass extinction events and infer potential ecological scenarios for our modern-day biotic crisis. 

3) The hypothesis reflects a good sense of curiosity for a new perspective on these mass extinctions, but should be a little more critical. While a similar thesis worked well for the Droser et al. paper, the author should clearly state why he hypothesizes that the similarity in taxonomic extinction levels for these two mass extinctions is significant, and specifically what difference in ecological impact he expects to find. Especially important is to take into consideration the drastically different causal processes and associated conditions surrounding the two events (something which could have been emphasized more in the Droser paper); just because they share one comparable feature doesnÕt make them free from confounding biases. However, the hypothesis on the whole is coherent and interesting: ecological perspectives on mass extinctions are useful and provide a breath of fresh air to the standard taxonomic ones. As far as I know, this specific pairing is novel, although I question whether it is novel for the sake of new insight to be gleaned from comparing the two or just a pairing for neatnessÕ sake. The hypothesis is certainly feasible with the data available from PBDB, although I would caution against focusing exclusively on terrestrial ecosystems (less availability of fossils, variable preservation, etc.) and motivate the author to seek a more complex analysis of many different Eltonian niche-levels instead of just tracking the ÔdominantÕ species. Finally, although the conditions surrounding either mass extinction are fairly distinct from the modern-day global changes, a better understanding of general ecological response to abiotic stressors and how it affects the trophic structure is very scientifically relevant for the next few millennia. 

4) The method section definitely laid the groundwork, but needs much more specific details as to how the hypothesis will be tested, e.g. what the expectations could be, what the conclusions to be drawn would be, etc. Furthermore, I felt that the justification for the study could be better enunciated.

 5) I recommended looking further into the methodology of Droser et al., 2000 or similar papers to gauge how feasible the study would be, as well as to gain some specific examples of methods for such a problem. I also recommended the author to download a small dataset from PBDB to explore the information for different taxa, specifically looking at the feeding and living strategies as potential ecological data for testing his hypothesis.

6) This paper definitely had some good sources for the introduction to the mass extinctions, but again IÕd emphasize clearly stating the different conditions surrounding each event and citing it so as not to appear ignorant to the differences. Despite this being a novel comparison, there must also be papers out there characterizing the ecological effects of either extinction: these should be referenced and used to strengthen the hypothesis, or to be challenged. I recommended similar studies referenced in the methods section as a means to easily expand the proposed approach without having to formulate a completely original experimental model.

Part 2
1) The reviewer rightfully pointed out that my hypothesis was not explicitly stated as it should be in the introduction; however, he understood the idea behind my proposal.

2) The reviewer brought attention to the fact that several paragraphs in my research justification section are poorly structured so as to introduce more background information, rather than make a case for the financing of this study. However, the reviewer also felt that the point relating my study to modern-day environments was well-structured and should be expanded upon.

3) The reviewer thought the analytical methods were well-drafted, although agreed that more details should be provided in future drafts.

4) I felt like this reviewer did a great job of providing advice and tips for my proposal draft. He did an especially excellent job of critiquing my formatting and structure of my proposal, advising me to provide a clearer hypothesis, restructure my justifications, and continue to develop my methods.

5) As per this reviewerÕs advice, I will restructure my introduction and justification and try to give greater amounts of detail when describing my hypothesis.
