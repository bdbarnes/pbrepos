### Reading Response: The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction (Payne and Finnegan, 2007)


#### Article Summary:

  Although major biotic crises i.e. the "Big Five" mass extinctions receive much of the attention in big data paleontology, background extinction on the genus level are estimated to have accounted for ~80% of all extinctions. In order to understand the contrast between these gradual, constant rates and the dramatic bursts of extinction, the authors of this paper took a regression approach to analyzing geographic range in relation to extinction selectivity. Using log-odds ratios, a 0 for a given 10My interval would indicate no correlation between geographical range and extinction, whereas a positive or negative value suggests such a correlation. Through this analysis the researchers found that geographic range was positively correlated with survivorship throughout nearly all intervals over the Phanerozoic, excepting the Permo-Triassic, Triassic, and Cretaceous ME events where log-odds significantly close to 0 laid. In addition, a multiple regression incorporating species richness as well as occurrence and range showed significantly low values for each of these three events as well as the Frasnian-Famennian. The authors wisely constrained these results by comparing geographic selectivity to several other metrics, thereby testing for heterogenous sampling: no significant biases were revealed. From these conclusions, the researchers infer a strong geographica selectivity during background extinction, whereas major global biotic crises – in which one or several processes acted in similar magnitudes on all plates – show selectivity by traits or genera but geographically indiscriminate selectivity.

  This is one of those characteristically method-focussed papers, in which the conclusion makes up one part and the explanation of arriving to that conclusion the other nineteen. However, although it was certainly not aimed at the layperson, this publication felt incredibly-well explained, and very self-aware. The conclusion being made, concerning the contrasting geographic selectivity during and between mass extinctions, is fairly incredible, so the authors spend much of the publication removing uncertainty and testing for confounding variables. Albeit dry,
