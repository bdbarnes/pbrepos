Reading Response: Decoupling of Taxonomic and Ecologic Severity (Droser et al., 2000)

## Article Summary

The evaluation of mass extinctions is often quantified by a figurative yardstick of species or families lost: however, the complex ecological perturbation and biodiversity crisis we are experiencing today shows that past mass extinctions were anything but simple. Droser et al. demonstrate how a measure of ecological severity resulting from biological crises not only allow for a new way to understand their effects, but a way to qualify the traditional taxonomic severity method.

Using the End Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions as case studies (two extinction events which yielded roughly equivalent proportions of marine family extinctions), the authors employ a categorization scheme to rank the ecological impact of the events on communities and ecosystems, ranging from first- to fourth-level impacts. In evaluating the End Ordovician event, the loss of families and higher taxa is considered, but the loss of certain megaguilds or ecological important groups such as dominants or keystones is added to the analyses. The End Ordovician experienced many taxonomic changes, particularly with regards to formerly tropical organisms being affected by the glaciation, but since most changes were on the community-type level the ecological severity is classified as a lower third- and fourth-level impact. Conversely, the Late Devonian event features massive turnover of metazoan reef communities, almost destroying the entire ecosystem structure globally. This is a second-order event and shows how ecological severity evaluation can yield very different interpretations of extinction events. 

## Things you liked about this paper:

This paper was highly enjoyable. In spite of the largely qualitative analysis, the methodology behind their ranking and classification was very clearly communicated, and the examples used to explain their reasoning are plentiful and also clear. Furthermore, it felt like a very smart way to provide a new perspective on mass extinctions, which are incredibly popular in paleontological literature but often presented as a one-dimensional impact on organisms and ecosystems. I also enjoyed the inclusion of the Sepkoski and Miller (1985) figure which further illustrated the traceability of secular paleoecological trends. 

## Things you did not like about this paper:

For all the strength that came from the listing of examples in each extinction, I would have been further impacted if the authors had found a way to use more figures, such as a taxonomic severity figure (i.e. the Sepkoski curve, etc.) coupled with an ecological trend diagram. I know this was essentially covered in the Sepkoski and Miller figure, but more detail and perhaps special focus on the ecologically dominant/keystone species abundances, such as the tabulate and stromatoporoid corals during the Devonian, would have made the comparisons and contrasts between the two events starker.

## Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

As mentioned above, there was only one figure, drawn from the Sepksoski and Miller 1985 paper. This was a good figure: I enjoyed the hybridization of the more visual, graphical paleoenvironmental section with the more statistical faunal ecological curves. One danger I noted was in using the terms Cambrian, Paleozoic, and modern fauna without greater explanation in this paper. The use of the figure also perhaps implied something intrinsically distinct about the faunal groups. When the authors talk about how Paleozoic fauna ÒinvadedÓ shallow-water niches during the Late Devonian event, it may sound like the Paleozoic fauna were especially suited to dominate during the perturbation, rather than just being a categorical way to distinguish evolutionary lineages of organisms which share no special adaptive characteristics.

 > This is an interesting question. Are the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern faunas of Sepkoski taxonomic, ecological, or both in nature.
