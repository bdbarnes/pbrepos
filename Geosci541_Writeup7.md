## Article Summary

While ecological and biodiversity studies can benefit greatly from the accumulated fossil record data and its time-averaging, noise-reducing boons, a whole new set of limitations and biases are introduced.

Hendy presents the inherent bias of lithified vs. unlithified sediments, the latter being only available in the recent record (Mesozoic and Cenozoic) and possibly exhibiting greater preservational potential and ease of access. The author frames this possible bias in the context of Phanerozoic biodiversity trends which historically indicate a three- to four-fold increase in diversity through the past 200 million years.

Utilizing a data set of New Zealand Late Miocene to Pleistocene marine invertebrate fossil assemblages, Hendy categorizes assemblages by degree of lithification, paleoenvironment, time interval, and using ubiquitous bivalve *Tawera* as a control across several lithologic categories and time intervals. Finally, size of fossils and their mineralogical composition was recorded. Using statistical tests, the range, distribution and diversity of each group was compared.

The analyzed fossil data indicates several trends:

1) through the Late Neogene, generic diversity increases;
2) the mean degree of lithification of samples decreases in the same time;
3) unlithified samples show higher richness, not confounded by sampling bias;
4) decreasing lithification correlates with greater preservation of small, fragile fossils and aragonitic hard parts.

From these observations, Hendy asserts that the uptick in biodiversity throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic can be partly explained by preservational effects, that is the increased preservation of certain fossils in unlithified sediments, and their greater abundance in recent times. 

## Things you liked about this paper:

This paper felt very thorough. The author did a great job laying out the various biases and confounding effects which face paleoecologists, and did not equivocate in presenting the many different possible sources for certain trends. On the other hand, the excellent inclusion of methods, data summaries, and figures provided a very robust support for the hypothesis. Moreover, the hypothesis and conclusion of this paper was just a fantastic idea that true or not, provides an excellent example of critical thinking and drawing upon well-designed experiments and big data to reexamine potential problems in our historical perception, i.e. the sudden rise in biodiversity through the past 200Ma. 

## Things you did not like about this paper:

Although I did very much benefit from seeing the citations of other works which support certain ideas and concepts, at a certain point the paper started to feel like more of a review, instead of delving further into the new points raised by this data. 

> Agreed!

Similarly, the methods were written with a very minute level of detail, but I would have benefitted from some better illustration of what some of the specimens of assemblages looked like, or where the different collections were sourced from: a visual to emphasize the non-data side of the experiment. Finally, the tone adopted so as not to overemphasize the findings or make any claims too broadly was very proper but also detracted to some degree from my understanding of what the authorÕs actual implications were, and what the data was illustrating: it took until the conclusion to re-center myself at the central conceit of the paper.

## Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

The graph and figure quality really varied. Figures 1, 2, and 5 all were excellent figures for comparing biodiversity and trends between categories or along time, although at times the figures seemed a little dense without easy-to-follow legends. Figures 3 and 4 were much harder to follow, both in understanding their point and following the data (3a and 4a used very indecipherable tone differences to differentiate unlithified and lithified collections Ð this completely obliterated any shot I had at understanding it). I am not convinced that these figures were the best illustration of a comparison between the two categories of lithification. Finally, Tables 1 and 2 were important to include so as to provide all the data, but like most data tables they were pretty dry. Table 2 benefitted more from showing the significance of the statistical tests.
