### Reading Response: Has the Earth's sixth mass extinction already arrived? (Barnosky et al., 2011)

#### Article Summary:

The authors start by establishing "mass extinctions" as events of biotic depletion during the Phanerozoic totalling over 75% species loss. Recent work by biologists and paleontologists alike have suggested that we may be initiating a third such event. Using data from the IUCN on extant species' levels of endangerment, the authors seek to test this hypothesis by comparing background and current extinction rates, and then extrapolating into the future to search for the intercept across the 75% threshhold. This is accomplished by estimating fossil extinctions per million-year bins over history and comparing to the loss of species in our recorded history. The latter is far to be far more rapid than the former, particularly when taking into account the assumption that endangered species will go extinct within 1000 years.

The comparison is furthered by evaluating the current crisis' magnitude in relation to previous mass extinctions. They point out the difficulties of doing this: for example, whereas brachiopods have been a very useful group of evaluating extinction events of the past, extant species of brachiopods today have been very poorly studied in terms of biodiversity and extinciton rates. Additionally, although one can estimate the rate of extinction for groups over the past 500 years, in order to extrapolate to mass extinction timescales one must calculate that rate acting over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. However, if one were to simply assume the extinction of threatened vertebrate species at a similar rate to the past 500 years, >75% species extinction would transpire in the next ~500-1500 years. From this, the authors interpret current extinction rate to be far greater than previous events'. However, the interpretation of the future will depend on better understanding background biodiversity today, the causal mechanisms for extinction, and an improved set of data and methods with which to work.

#### Things you liked about this paper:

This paper set out on a herculean task to reconcile modern-day conservation biology with traditional big-data paleontology, and largely succeeded in addressing both of these fields' shortcomings, uncertainties, and biases. The authors weren't so ambitious as to make broad hypotheses without acknowledging their limitations, and certainly don't try to overextrapolate into the future. Although it might come off as a conservative approach to evaluating this question of the 'sixth mass extinction,' which could hardly be more dramatic or alarmist, this is a necessity for scientists doing any work on controversial and more importantly highly political topics in the modern day, such as climate change. Overextending an argument sets one up for rebuttals, very valid criticisms, and the weakening of an entire argument such that it sets all proponents of that hyopothesis back.

#### Things you did not like about this paper:

While I approve of the manner in which this paper was written, I can't help but feel underwhelmed by their methods. They acknowledge the dearth of data with regards to small marine invertebrates, and rightfully turn to a more complete data-set for vertebrates, but they don't clearly state that all of the previous 'Big 5' mass extinctions were and are still most observable in marine invertebrate biodiversity dynamics; the same reason that larger vertebrates are easier to study today makes them poorly preserved and sampled in the fossil record. While this isn't a direct criticism of their model design, it does underline the juxtaposition of modern-day biodiversity and fossil biodiversity studies. In many ways, it's comparing apples to oranges, or more accurately a set of vintage wines to freshly-stomped grapes. For all the uncertainties of extrapolation and interpretation mentioned in this paper, it never addresses the more paleontological question of whether these species losses over the past 500 years will preserve in the record in a way that will make them observable in millions of years time: while it doesn't bely its status as a biotic crisis, a mass extinction on par with the previous five must be comparable on all levels, and this includes preservation and observation in the fossil record following lithification. Furthermore, they never stop to ask whether this high-speed depletion of species could have similarly occurred at many intervals in the past, but because of its fast occurrence and quick rebound failed to preserve in the sedimentological record. There are too many uncommon variables between conservation biology and paleontology for easy comparisons, noble as this paper's effort may be. I do believe the answer to this question will come from collaboration between the two sciences, but for this paper that barely scratches the surface, no convincing or satisfying point is made besides that rates of endangerment and threat to today's biosphere is unprecedented for one reason alone: humanity's ability to both cause a biotic crisis and record it as it occurs. Perhaps we should give such a unique occurrence its own credit, instead of looking for a sexy way to tie it into the paleontological record.

#### Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

The figures and graphs mean well, but don't provide that much visualization. To their credit, Tables 1 and 2 do a comprehensive summation of the previous 'Big Five' mass extinctions' effects and causes, and the methodology of calculating extinction rates with previous studies referenced, respectively. Figues 1 and 2 seek to contrast the modern-day rate of extinction with the previous 10 Myr, and the magnitude of extinction with previous events. However, the former is slightly ambiguous without illustrating a clear concise point (aside from the fact that data spreads more towards the modern and has an  upwards trend in extinction rate, something easily gleaned from text) and requires a column-length caption, while the later attempts to place the magnitude of extinction and endangerment of IUCN taxa against mass extinctions. However, this comes off as slightly cartoonish and again, doesn't give that much better a visualization of the point than a table or text would. Figure 3 is by far the most effective, but also suffers from cartoonishness and curiously poor-resolution data points and text. Here the authors extrapolate extinction rates of various clades, emphasizing the trajectory before their decline reaches ME-levels, but this figure suffers from its adherence to vertebrate data only. Thus, the KT mass extinction appears to be the event of greatest magnitude, towering over the Permian, and representing this paper's inability to provide an appreciation for invertebrate biodiversity and a communication of what makes mass extinctions in the fossil record unique: yes, their rapid rate of decline, but furthermore a devastating, albeit at times uncertain, causal mechanism, and oftentimes geographically and taxonomically global catastrophe, striking a diverse group of phyla and leaving a record of their destruction in the most inaccessible depths of the ocean and across the most adaptable and minute invertebrates. Continuing the popularized image of mass extinctions necessitating the deaths of the largest and most impressive/popular species to be important only devalues the underappreciated victims of past mass extinctions and perpetuates the underappreciation of those that we're losing currently, from insects to copepods to corals to frogs. The true tipping point in the current biotic crisis will come not from purposeful slaughter of the world's rainforests, but from the one-track mindedness of the world attempting to save those dumb-as-a-sack-of-nails pandas while every ugly, small keystone species goes extinct behind their backs.
