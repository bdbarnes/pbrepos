####Reading Response: Cenozoic latitudinal response curves (Zaffos and Miller, 2015)

####Article Summary:
Several studies have observed a pattern throughout the Miocene-Pleistocene interval of marine bivalves having their First Appearance Datum in the tropics, and their Last Appearance Datum in the extratropics, implying a long-term poleward expansion or migration of the genera geographic ranges. The authors of this study utilized the PaleoBiology Database and Gaussian Logistic Regression to test this hypothesis quantitatively. Using probability of collection of a genus as a proxy for peak abundance, and assuming gradient theory conditions in which genus range is clustered symmetrical latitudinally around this peak, the authors gathered range width (latitudinal tolerance) and mean latitude of each distribution (preferred latitude) and plotted them on scatterplots across each epoch-epoch comparison in the Cenozoic. The results showed weakly correlating but unanimous trends of equatorward tendencies for preferred latitude and movement towards intermediate range sizes for the latitudinal tolerance. First differences within each factor were also plotted using a normalized rank order, and showed very similar hollow curves which suggested small latitudinal changes were much more ubiquitous than large latitudinal changes. From these analyses, the authors concluded that there was no strong evidence for poleward migration, instead showing the inverse. They reason that this could be due to sampling bias or time-averaging effect, or could also suggest a real trend due to cooling climates or "bridge species" originating in the tropics before expanding poleward. Moreover, the hollow curves suggest that biogeographic distributions exhibit conservatism, as the average changes in each factor were significantly smaller than would be expected by chance. While the data do show small changes in range and optimal latitude, throughout the diverse climates and environmental pressures of the Cenozoic there is a relative stability in genera if not individual species, showing the power of biogeographic conservatism in geologic periods of time.

####Things you liked about this paper:
One refreshing element I found in this paper is the clear outlining of a hypothesis in the introduction, a presentation of the data, and then a conclusion which unambiguously does not support the hypothesis. Too often papers are presented in such a manner that it seems assumed the hypothesis in question will be supported and unequivocally confirmed, giving the impression that science is more akin to a gumball machine of confirmation rather than the difficult stuffed-animal claw machine, where for every hypothesis luckily plucked up by the claw of confirmation dozens are dropped or missed due to insignificant data or ambiguous results. Here, the authors take a stance on the unsupportive trends of the data, and propose several new hypotheses to explain them, making proverbial lemonade from the data-lemons.

Another thing I liked in the paper was its frank description of the methods of data analysis, showing each step and taking the time to provide an explanation for how each one works and justify their use. Figure 2 and Table 1 are especially appreciated, because they are provided not to highlight just the significant data but to give a broader understanding of how conclusions were reached. With the level of detail in this paper I felt like I would be able to replicate the study, which is exactly what methods sections should enable the reader to do.

####Things you did not like about this paper:
One way in which I felt the paper could improve would be to provide better imagery to illustrate the concepts instead of the data. The figures and table were excellent with regards to the analyses, but I would have enjoyed a figure more in line with Figure 1, showing some of the actual data curves on a map or latitudinal line, to visually represent what the data numerically told us. While trying to create a figure with all of the data would be cumbersome and too busy, a figure in the vein of last weekÕs paper on niche conservatism among mammal genera, where several genera or a family were chosen as an example of how the data looked on a map, would have been appreciated.
> This is a good point. It's always important to have a solid understanding of the underlying data and to explore them visually before analysis. This is often cut out of papers, which is too bad.

####Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:
The figures and tables were, with the exception of the above point, immensely appreciated. Figure 1 gave a great representation of the parameters and concepts involved in the research, and Figures 2 through 5 each succinctly and helpfully showed the data, as well as underscored the points being made in the discussion. I particularly enjoyed Table 1 as a show of bootstrapping being used to verify the dataÕs significance. My one suggestion would be that Figure 5, showing the proportion of tropical to extratropical occurrences in collections for each epoch, might have had a bigger impact on me if it had been presented as a stacked bar chart showing percentages rather than occurrences, since the sample sizes varied so much that the difference in proportions was less clear from epoch to epoch. However, I recognize the importance of visualizing the sample size differences as well, so this suggestion is a very minor one.
