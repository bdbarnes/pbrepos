### Reading Response: Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years (Sakamoto, Benton, and Vendetti, 2016)

#### Article Summary:

The end-Cretaceous impact event is perhaps the most famous mass extinction in Earth's history, not for its magnitude but for the abrupt disappearance of non-avian dinosaurs which ended the Cretaceous and the dreams of many a child who longed for a pet Stegosaurus. However, the authors of this paper bring up a lack of statistical rigor in some data-sets used to support this one-hit KO of the dinosaurs, citing data oversights and methodological shortcomings when supporting this traditional interpretation.

Using a new comprehensive database, the authors set out to phylogenetically determine the speciation and extinction rate dynamics across the major dinosaur clades. Plotting the speciation:extinction rates of Ornithiscians, Sauropodomorphans, and Theropodans, a distinctive apex curve is created with a peak around the Early Cretaceous and a descent towards the KT boundary. Similarly, net speciation curves show a decine into negative territory right around the Early-Late Cretaceous boundary.
