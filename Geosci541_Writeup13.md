### Reading Response: Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years (Sakamoto, Benton, and Vendetti, 2016)

#### Article Summary:

The end-Cretaceous impact event is perhaps the most famous mass extinction in Earth's history, not for its magnitude but for the abrupt disappearance of non-avian dinosaurs which ended the Cretaceous and the dreams of many a child who longed for a pet Stegosaurus. However, the authors of this paper bring up a lack of statistical rigor in some data-sets used to support this one-hit KO of the dinosaurs, citing data oversights and methodological shortcomings when supporting this traditional interpretation.

Using a new comprehensive database, the authors set out to phylogenetically determine the speciation and extinction rate dynamics across the major dinosaur clades. Plotting the speciation:extinction rates of Ornithiscians, Sauropodomorphans, and Theropodans, a distinctive apex curve is created with a peak around the Early Cretaceous and a descent towards the KT boundary. Similarly, net speciation curves show a decine into negative territory right around the Early-Late Cretaceous boundary. Even Mesozoic birds had similar speciation curves, their radiation in the end-Jurassic not prucluding them from a late Cretaceous decline. Several exceptions are noted, e.g. the high rates of speciation in hadrisauriforms and ceratopsids due to increased provinciality and ecotaxa changes. However, in explaining the hypothesized speciation decline in the Cretaceous, the authors included methods to account for ecological niches fostering interspecific competition, and saw no such signal. Additionally, they incorporated into their model the potential for sea-level rise fosterning allopatric speciation, and showed that the model supported such a relationship. However, the decline through the end-Cretaceous across dinosaur taxa remains enigmatic, with potential causes in volcanism, climate change, plate tectonic movement, or some manner of ecological crisis. They further propose that this decline may have indirectly paved the way for a mammalian rise and radiation which marked the early Paleogene.

#### Things you liked about this paper:

This paper was yet another in our long reading list of papers in which the authors clearly describe and articulate the findings and implication of a data-based model, without tiring or losing the reader. These authors in particular provide a good balance of phlyogenetic and taxonomic details, computational explanations, and broader descriptive implications and description of causes. This is the strong point of the paper, and is further ameliorated by the figures which, although highly methodological, paint a clear picture of their points and support the main arguments even to the layperson perspective.

#### Things you did not like about this paper:

While they frame their points and arguments very well, aided by the figures, the discussion doesn't feel complete. In particular, although they do an excellent job in justifying their methods and interpretations, I was left wondering if their speciation rate metric was as robust as they say, and furthermore, if it was the best way to tackle such an unwieldy and traditionally murkily-classified group as the dinosaurs. In their methods they acknowledge the potential for confounding variables, but write it off rather abruptly. Signor-Lipps effects go unmentioned, and the potential for a bias in the rock record too. Furthermore, they don't acknowledge the inherent difficulty of confiding in the dinosaur species classifications: historically the patchy preservation of bones and overzealous paleontologists have led to a great redundancy in species names, and this could affect the robustness of their study. Finally, speciation rates are not the end-all metric for diversity, and may simplify the fossil record. Does a decline in speciation rates necessitate a decline in species? Or could it represent a plateau in the dinosaurian biosphere for an epoch?

While not all of these concerns are necessarily valid, that the authors generally ignore them or fail to justify their decisions in detail leaves their stong argument seem more a façade, hiding an unacknowledged uncertainty.

Oh, and it's absolutely infuriating how every single article online about any new studies on mass extinction events includes the line, "these findings may help us understand more about the current mass extinction occurring right before our very eyes." Give us a break, not every book is written to improve your child's literacy, not every boat is built to circumnavigate the Earth. This trend, which I once looked favorably upon for increasing support for such research and having an optomistic tone, just serves to ingrain into the public conception of science that every project must be able to in some way influence a tangible goal for the future, or else it's irrelevent. Shoehorning that hackneyed phrase every where just serves to devalue the people who are working hard to actually change the current **biotic crisis**, and it devalues the scientists who work hard to understand the past for its own sake, not in some glamorous attempt to change the future for their fellow humans. Self-interested science may be esoteric at times, but trying to find a purpose for everything just produces a cynical new generation who look for the golden solution in every proposal and snub the interesting but non-pragmatic ones.


#### Evaluate the Graphs and Figures:

The figures and graphs were pretty great, as far as illustrating a methodology I have some reservations about. Figure 1 was actually a fairly concise and clear illustration of a concept, which was surprising to me after last week's Benton paper. Figures 2A and 2B showed the brunt of the findings, the log speciation rates as a unified curve for each group and then for each dinosaur grouo separately, which supported their argument that declines occurred across each clade. I must compliment the eye-catching use of color to differentiate the groups and curves, and the subtle illustration of different model trials to show noise. Fig. 3A communicated effectively and aesthetically the phlyogenetic decline in speciation, and 3B the net speciation rates, maintaining an attractive template, the memorable color assignments, and overall simplicity. All in all, the figures were a powerful part of this paper, and it would have undoubtedly been less understandable and more boring without them.
